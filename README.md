```

```
REACT_APP_SYNC_GATEWAY="http://localhost:4984"

"docker-down": "docker-compose down",
```


- Bear in mind that the default behavior of fetch is to ignore the Set-Cookie header completely. To opt into accepting cookies from the server, you must use the credentials option.

For [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests, use the "include" value to allow sending credentials to
other domains:

```javascript
fetch('https://example.com:1234/users', {
  credentials: 'include'
})
```
